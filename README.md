TravelHub Board : https://trello.com/b/x9TYeRLr/travelhub

☐ Breakdown of Responsibilities:
Alyssa - responsible for the server, database and controller/routing:
Mackenzie - responsible for the models, users authentication and registration:
Faiza - responsible for the views and the CSS

☐ Strengths:
Our biggest strengths as a group was our ability to organize and communicate amongst one another. Our initial planning really set us up for the rest of this project. Also, delegation and management of task, especially when our deadline was closing in, was handled very well.

☐ Weaknesses:
Our biggest weaknesses during this project were time management and our use of class resources. During the project we often spent too much time troubleshooting a bug before seeking help. Setting timers/deadlines for how long we work on an issue eariler in the project would have keep on task and in the long run saved us time. Also, using class resources are a baseline in the beginning of the project would have saved time as well. 

☐ Biggest challenge:
Our biggest challanges during this project would be implementing comments into the post show page, and troubleshooting filepaths. Adding the comments feature into the application was challenging, because it was similar to what we learned in class but not entirely; it took a bit of creativity and pushing ourselves and our knowledge of the material to add this feature. The filepaths were particularly tricky for us. Using the correct filepaths in our partials were a challenge and we also ran into trouble deploying to Heroku because of the model filenames.


☐ Key learnings/takeaways:
Key takeaways from this project would be structuring and planning of the website, including the filename/paths and the layers of the website are better done early in the project. During the project we learned a great deal about building a web application from the frontend, particularly CSS, and a great deal about backend and how these two disciplines work together. 

☐ Improvements:
Our group definitely wants to add a communities feature to this project, as well as, continuing to work on CSS.


o Highlight Code:
The Authentication was a stretch goal we where very proud to reach. Here is alittle bit of code we really like writing.

```
 app.use(function (req, res, next) {
    res.locals.user = req.session.currentUser;
    next();
  });

  const authRequired = function (req, res, next) {
    if (req.session.currentUser) {
      return next();
    }
  
    return res.redirect("/login");
  };
